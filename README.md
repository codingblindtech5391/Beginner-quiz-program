# Quiz Game Project Documentation

## Introduction

The Quiz Game project is a Python-based interactive quiz application designed for educational purposes. This document provides an overview of the project structure, functionality, and key components.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a file named `project_outline.py` and may include additional files or folders as the project evolves. The main script, `project_outline.py`, orchestrates the quiz game.

## Key Components

### 1. `display_question(question)`

- **Description:** Displays the current quiz question.
- **Parameters:**
  - `question`: Dictionary containing the text of the question.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  display_question(question)
  ```

### 2. `get_user_input()`

- **Description:** Retrieves user input for the answer to the displayed question.
- **Returns:** User input as a string.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  user_response = get_user_input()
  ```

### 3. `check_answer(user_answer, correct_answer)`

- **Description:** Compares the user's answer with the correct answer to determine correctness.
- **Parameters:**
  - `user_answer`: User-provided answer as a string.
  - `correct_answer`: Correct answer for the current question.
- **Returns:** Boolean indicating whether the answer is correct.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  is_correct = check_answer(user_response, question['answer'])
  ```

### 4. `quiz()`

- **Description:** Main function to execute the quiz game.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  quiz()
  ```

## Project Execution

To run the quiz game, execute the `project_outline.py` script. The script initializes the quiz, presents questions in a randomized order, evaluates user responses, and provides a final score upon completion.

## Customization

Expand the project by adding more questions to the `questions` list within the `quiz()` function. Additionally, you can introduce new features, modify the user interface, or include multimedia elements to enhance the learning experience.

## Conclusion

The Quiz Game project serves as a comprehensive introduction to Python programming concepts, including variables, data types, operations, program flow, functions, and the use of built-in modules. Feel free to adapt and extend the project to meet specific educational objectives.
